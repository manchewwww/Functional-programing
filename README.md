## Algorithm for solving exercises

    1. What is the name of the procedure/function?
    2. How many parameters does it take?
    3. What is the type of the parameters?
    4. What are the names of the parameters?
    5. What is the return type?
    6. Break the task into smaller tasks. List them.
